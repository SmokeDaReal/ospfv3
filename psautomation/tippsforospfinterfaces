# If at this point the expected OSPF neighbor states are still not formed                  #
# there are only a couple of other configuration possibilites that could cause the problem #
#                                                                                          #
# These possiblities include:                                                              #
#   - Hello/Dead timer intervals not matching on the neighboring interfaces                #
#   - One/Both of the interfaces are configured to be excluded from OSPF communication     #
#   - A security scheme, such as an extended ACL is blocking OSPF communication            #
#   - Mismatched subnet masks on the neighboring interfaces                                #
#   - Physical/link-level errors are occuring                                              #
#                                                                                          #
# Configurations that were checked in this Troubleshooting process                         #
# but could be beneficial to investigate them further:                                     #
#   - Neighbor is inactive/down                                                            #
#   - Neighbor does not have OSPFv3 enabled                                                #
#   - Neighbor does not have routerId configured or has incorrect routerId                 #
#     (should not be an issue as long as the present routerIds are unique)                 #
#   - OSPF areas are not/misconfigured on the neighboring interfaces                       #
#     (if they match, the adjacency should still form between the routers)                 #
#                                                                                          #
